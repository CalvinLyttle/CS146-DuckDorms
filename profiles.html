                    <h3>Castle Point Hall</h3>
                    <p>CPH consists entirely of triples. Located conveniently as far as possible away from literally everything, this hall at least provides you with lovely views of New York (which it is probably closer to than it is to your classes).
                        <br>If you love the excitement of fire alarms, this is the dorm for you.

                    <h3>Davis Hall</h3>
                    <p>A fantastic dorm for fans of construction, Davis Hall provides the entertainment of crazy people in lounges as well as opportunities to play "guess what diseases are living in the communal bathrooms."</p>

                    <h3>Humphreys Hall</h3>
                    <p>The official dorm of "oh yeah, that exists". Humphreys has the distinction of being not quite as bad as Palmer, but holds the record for the second to worst dorm.</p>

                    <h3>Jonas Hall</h3>
                    <p>Jonas Hall is the biggest, with hundreds of residents hitting their heads on shelving units every day. With stunning views of absolutely nothing, those with odd numbered rooms get to be serenaded by frat parties every night.</p>

                    <h3>Palmer Hall</h3>
                    <p>Home to roughly two residents, Palmer Hall is always there to be the absolute last option. Palmer is also versitile in its ability to be both a dorm and a joke at the same time.</p>

                    <h3>River Terrace Suites</h3>
                    <p>River Terrace is the home to those that are too good for normal dorms. This dorm is handicap accessible for students that have paid an arm and a leg to live the suite life.</p>
